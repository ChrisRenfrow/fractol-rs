# Fractol (Rust edition)

Time to `#RewriteItInRust`!

This is the Rust version of [a project](https://github.com/ChrisRenfrow/fractol) I completed back when I was attending 42 US. The objective is to create a CLI tool which spawns a graphical window displaying one of three (or more) fractals. Using the scroll wheel (or other forms of input) the user may scale the fractal up and down to explore.

## Objective

### Base

- [ ] A program which launches an application window that displays the selected fractal (passed as an argument)
- [ ] Should provide a selection of at least 3 different types of fractals 
    - [ ] Julia
    - [ ] Mandelbrot
    - [ ] My choice!

### Controls

- [ ] Scroll-wheel should zoom in and out "infinitely"
- [ ] Julia should be manipulated with mouse movement
- [ ] **Bonus:** Zoom should be centered on the mouse pointer

### Visuals

- [ ] Use several colors to demonstrate the "depth" of the fractal
- [ ] **Bonus:** Configurable color-themes
- [ ] **Extra bonus:** "Marching" color themes (think blinking christmas lights)
